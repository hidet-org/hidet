As other programming languages, Hidet Script has its type system, expressions, statements, functions, and modules.

Each module is a compilation unit, and it contains a collection of functions and global variables. Each function
executes a series of statements. The function can define variables and manipulate them. Each variable has its data
type.

The details of the type system, expressions, statements, functions, and modules are described in the following sections.
